### PHP Front Controller for HTTP applications (in development)

##### Goals: Framework should be *easy to learn* when programming is *difficult to master*
- minimum conventions, simple API
- plain SOLID code and hermetic abstractions
- decoupled from application by design
- encourage pure OOP
- no imposed architecture - stateless HTTP context only
- add and learn the libraries you need
- experiment ready - have fun

##### Concepts:
- [x] Front controller as PSR-15 request handler
- [x] encapsulated configuration
- [x] PSR-11 container (optional use)
- [x] composite routing (polymorphic structure)
- [ ] middleware in routing paths
- [ ] PSR-7 implementations
