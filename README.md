# HTTP
### PHP Front Controller for HTTP applications (in development)

##### Goals: Framework should be *easy to learn* when programming is *difficult to master*
- minimum conventions, simple API
- plain SOLID code and hermetic abstractions
- decoupled from application by design
- encourage pure OOP
- no imposed architecture - stateless HTTP context only
- add and learn the libraries you need
- experiment ready - have fun

##### Concepts:
- [ ] encapsulated configuration
- [ ] PSR-11 container (optional use)
- [ ] composite routing (polymorphic structure)
- [ ] middleware (context setting) in routing paths
- [ ] PSR-7 implementations
